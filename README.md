# Optimization-with-covid-19-data
Optimization-Optimization methods are used in many areas of study to find solutions that maximize or minimize some study parameters, such as minimize costs in the production of a good or service, maximize profits, minimize raw material in the development of a good, or maximize production.Here in this project, we minimized the transportation cost of vaccines by using optimization.
We used https://github.com/AjayKumarRedu/Optimization-with-covid-19-data/blob/main/myData.tVaccMi.csv for optimization
in this data we have following columns-
* Date -specific date 
* FIPS - Code of county
* Completeness_pct - how many percentage of population got vaccinated
* SVI_CTGY	- severity of patient 
* Census2019 - population of county a.c.t. census 2019
* tVaccMi - county's distance from (states of) vaccine manufacture.
